My name is Slim. I am a computer scientist and 17th grade student at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com/) under the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I have also collaborated with [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) and [Notion](https://notion.so/about) during my PhD.

My research interests span programming languages, human factors, learning sciences, and personal computing.
I’m interested in _programming languages as user interfaces_: in short, how language design affects the way people think about and write programs.
For instance, I ask questions about the usability of static type systems, the role of functional programming within computing education, and how provable guarantees might alleviate cognitive load while writing software.

Previously I helped build tools for personal computing and collaboration at [Notion](https://notion.so/about); worked in the [Early Product Development](https://early.khanacademy.org/) group at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org); and interned with the [Human Experience and Design](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/future-of-work/) group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). 

I received my BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://northwestern.edu), concentrating in human-computer interaction and theoretical computer science.
My studies were supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship), and others, for which I am grateful, though these companies do not necessarily represent my views.
During undergrad I was affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/), where I researched [CSS inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2dFxxBh2K4) with my co-advisors [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O&rsquo;Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com).
- [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/), where I researched [peer grading algorithms](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1733860) with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline).
- [Center for Connected Learning](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/), where I worked on [NetLogo Web](https://netlogoweb.org/) with [Jason Bertsche](https://github.com/TheBizzle).

Auxiliary interests include [browser engines](https://servo.org/), type systems, text editors, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org), [crossword puzzles](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1002202872266874880), [document preparation](https://pandoc.org/), coiling and soldering custom USB cables, playing games on the Nintendo Switch, backpacking, jazz, and critical theory. I have also invested an outsized amount of time into several hobbies:

- I am a classically-trained flutist, currently studying with [Evan Pengra Sult](https://blogpnborg.wordpress.com/2020/12/14/letters-from-pnb-artists-evan-pengra-sult-pnb-orchestra-member/).
- I received my [Wilderness First Responder](https://www.wms.org/magazine/1176/WFR-Scope-Of-Practive) training through [NOLS](https://nols.edu/) and CPR training through the [AHA BLS course](https://cpr.heart.org/en/cpr-courses-and-kits/healthcare-professional/basic-life-support-bls-training), and am currently pursuing wilderness and urban EMT certification.
- My goal is to ride every Amtrak long-distance route with a West Coast terminus. So far I’ve taken the [California Zephyr](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/california-zephyr-train.html) twice, [Coast Starlight](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/coast-starlight-train.html) four times, [Sunset Limited](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/sunset-limited-train.html) once, and I have a trip scheduled on the [Empire Builder](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/empire-builder-train.html).
- Policy debate is a [niche](https://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff-debateteam/), [all-consuming](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/11/revenge-nerds/), and [occasionally-fraught](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/debatable) subculture that occupied my entire brain for six years.
    - In high school I founded the [Interlake Policy Debate](https://www.facebook.com/InterlakeDebate/) team, which continues to be a nationally-successful program ten years later. My younger teammate Jessica Jiang produced a wonderful [genealogy](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/sharksforever/) of the team. 
    - In college I briefly joined the [Northwestern Debate Society](https://communication.northwestern.edu/debate-society/), where I helped secure our historic [15th national championship](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2015/04/northwestern-debate-society-wins-record-15th-title) before quitting to become a computer scientist. 

    Debate has shaped me profoundly, more than any other activity by far (including computer science). Bootstrapping a high school team with no resources or coaching remains the hardest thing I have ever accomplished (including all of my technical and research accomplishments).

Here are a few of my 99 theses, and other topics I’ve written about:

- [Stop using “uni-typed” pejoratively to dunk on dynamically-typed languages](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1317331148360437760)
- [Chunking mathematical notation helps with understanding](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1409663659341619206)
- [I wish we understood why programmers have such poor intuitions about performance](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1313614499736297472)
- [Block vs. inline is a leaky and unintuitive abstraction for document editors](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1285324183413518337)
- [“Listening and learning” is the new “thoughts and prayers”](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1282736177305403392)
- [Code review should use a directed graph, not a linked list](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1275922682895192065)
- [Articulating injustice is more important than, but not mutually exclusive with, preserving your intellectual brand](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1267228511233667072)
- [Type errors are our friends and teachers](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1140838786043002881) (*and corollary:* [Better error messages help users conceptualize compilers as friendly guides rather than angry jerks](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1334654707575353345))
