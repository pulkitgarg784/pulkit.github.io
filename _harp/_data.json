      "description": "CSS is syntactically straightforward, but has a steep learning curve and complicated semantics. Inspecting the source of existing webpages can help illustrate concepts, but such webpages are typically too complex to serve as useful learning materials. Drawing inspiration from prior research in both software engineering and the learning sciences, we present a novel web inspection tool and set of techniques for analyzing relevant CSS. We introduce the concept of <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sliminality/c44df66647fe9a252b0064d3259fde74\">implicit dependencies</a> between CSS properties, which represent a major source of confusion for programmers.
